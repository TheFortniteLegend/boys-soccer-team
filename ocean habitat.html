<h2>The shark</h2>

<p>Sharks are fishes and most have the typical fusiform body shape. Like other fishes, sharks are ectothermic (cold-blooded), live in water, have fins, and breathe with gills. However, sharks differ from Osteichthyes fish. One difference is that a shark's skeleton is made of cartilage instead of bone. Another visible difference is that bony fish tend to have a single gill slit, whereas all but two species of shark have 5 gill slits.
    Male: External claspers located on the far underside of the body – forward of the caudal fin – distinguish males.SizeThe largest shark is the 13.7 m (45 ft) whale shark. The 22 to 25 cm (8.7 to 9.8 in.) midwater shark and pygmy ribbontail catshark are among the smallest.WeightNo dataDietThe characteristic teeth of each species are adapted to that particular species' diet. The teeth may be serrated or smooth. Most are used for seizing prey, cutting, or crushing. Some sharks are probably not very picky about what they eat. But certain kinds of sharks eat some foods more than others. For example, hammerhead sharks eat mostly stingrays. Tiger sharks eat sea turtles. And whale sharks eat plankton.GestationDepends on the species: oviparous (egg laying), viviparous (live birth), and ovoviviparous ("egg live birth")Sexual MaturityNo dataLife SpanBecause sharks grow slowly and have a low reproductive rate, scientists believe that sharks are relatively long-lived. As of yet, there is no accurate way to determine the age and lifespan of a shark.RangeWorldwideHabitatSharks live all over the world, from warm, tropical lagoons to polar seas. Some even inhabit freshwater lakes and rivers.PopulationGlobal: No dataStatusIUCN: Several species listed
    CITES: Several species listed
    USFWS: Not listed</p>

<h2>orcas</h2>
<p>Hunting and Diet
    Though they often frequent cold, coastal waters, orcas can be found from the polar regions to the Equator. They're at the top of the food chain and have very diverse diets, feasting on fish, penguins, and marine mammals such as seals, sea lions, and even whales, employing teeth that can be four inches long. They are known to grab seals right off the ice. They also eat fish, squid, and seabirds.

    Orcas hunt in deadly pods, family groups of up to 40 individuals. There appear to be both resident and transient pod populations of orcas. These different groups may prey on different animals and use different techniques to catch them. Resident pods tend to prefer fish, while transient pods target marine mammals. All pods use effective, cooperative hunting techniques that some liken to the behavior of wolf packs.

    Orcas are protective of their young, and other adolescent females often assist the mother in caring for them. Mothers give birth every three to ten years, after a 17-month pregnancy. They give birth to one baby at a time, which may nurse for up to two years. In most cases, the bond between juvenile and mother will eventually weaken, and the young orca will go its own way, but in some pods, the juvenile may stay with the pod it was born into its entire life.</p>
